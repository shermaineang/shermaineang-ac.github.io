The consistency and quality of food reflected Japan’s strong emphasis on craftsmanship and pride in work.\n\n\n\n\nWhat stood out to me about Japanese cuisine: - Strong focus on freshness and quality\n- Careful presentation that enhances the dining experience\n- Respect for ingredients and cooking processes\nThese values resonated with me, as they reflect principles such as precision, consistency, and continuous improvement, which are also important in computing and project work.\n\n\n\n\nTraveling in Japan encouraged me to become more observant, adaptable, and respectful of cultural differences.\nNavigating transportation systems, understanding social norms, and managing daily plans independently strengthened my confidence and problem-solving skills.\nThis experience reinforced the importance of designing systems—whether technical or social—that are intuitive, reliable, and user-focused.\n\n\n\n\nThe lessons from this trip influence how I approach my academic work: - Greater appreciation for well-designed systems and workflows\n- Improved adaptability when learning new concepts\n- Stronger awareness of global perspectives, especially in technology-driven societies\nIn Applied Computing, understanding user behaviour across different cultures is increasingly valuable.\n\n\n\n\nOverall, my travel experience in Japan was both inspiring and educational.\nIt broadened my perspective and continues to influence how I think about design, efficiency, and problem-solving in my academic and future professional journey."
