## Personal Interest: Animals 🐾 

I have a strong fondness for **dogs and cats** and enjoy learning about animals and their behaviour. Although I do not currently own a pet, I appreciate opportunities to interact with animals, such as spending time with friends’ pets or engaging with animal-related content.

Being around animals provides a sense of calm and emotional comfort, helping me manage stress during academically demanding periods. I believe that positive human–animal interactions contribute to mental well-being and promote empathy and patience.

- Interacting with pets helps reduce stress and mental fatigue  
- Observing animals encourages empathy and emotional awareness  
- This interest reminds me to maintain balance between work and personal well-being

## Music as a Source of Motivation 🎵

Music plays an important role in helping me stay focused and motivated, especially during long study or project sessions.  
The video below features a song by **Stray Kids**, a group whose music I enjoy for its strong energy, meaningful messages, and themes of perseverance and self-growth.
