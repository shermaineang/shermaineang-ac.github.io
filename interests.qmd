## 1) Financial Technology (FinTech)

I am interested in how technology can make financial services more **efficient**, **secure**, and **accessible**. FinTech appeals to me because it combines technical challenges with real-world impact.

In particular, I enjoy learning about:
- **Digital payments & financial platforms** — how systems handle speed, scale, and reliability  
- **Risk and fraud detection** — using data patterns to identify unusual behaviour  
- **Personal finance & automation** — tools that support better financial decision-making  

**Why this matters to me:**  
FinTech operates at the intersection of technology and everyday life. Understanding these systems motivates me to learn how reliable and user-focused solutions are designed.

## 2) Data Analytics & Visualisation

I enjoy analysing data and transforming it into insights that are **clear**, **accurate**, and **easy to understand**.

Some aspects I find particularly engaging include:
- Cleaning and structuring messy datasets  
- Choosing appropriate visuals based on the purpose (trend, comparison, relationship)  
- Writing concise explanations that help non-technical audiences interpret results  

**How it helps me:**  
This interest strengthens my ability to support decisions with evidence and communicate findings effectively, which is valuable in both technical and collaborative environments.

## 3) Software Development & Problem-Solving

I enjoy building practical solutions through programming and iterative improvement.

This includes:
- Writing clean, readable, and maintainable code  
- Debugging issues systematically  
- Designing small features that solve specific problems  

**How it helps me:**  
Software development trains my logical thinking and attention to detail, while also teaching patience and persistence when solving complex problems.

## 4) Continuous Learning & Growth

I value consistent and reflective learning over last-minute memorisation. My preferred learning habits include:
- Keeping concise notes (commands, templates, common mistakes)  
- Practising through small tasks rather than only reading theory  
- Reflecting on what worked and what could be improved after each assignment  

**How it helps me:**  
These habits help me stay organised, reduce repeated mistakes, and steadily improve across different modules and projects.

## 🚀 Looking Ahead

Moving forward, I hope to continue developing these interests by:
- Applying FinTech concepts to real datasets  
- Building small tools or dashboards to practise analytics  
- Strengthening my technical foundation while maintaining a reflective learning mindset
