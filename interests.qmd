title: "Interests"

This page highlights a few areas I enjoy exploring outside of my core modules.  
My interests reflect a mix of **technology**, **finance**, and **personal growth**, and they influence how I approach learning and project work.

## 1) Financial Technology (FinTech)

I am interested in how technology can make financial services more efficient, secure, and accessible.  
In particular, I enjoy learning about:

- **Digital payments & financial platforms** (how systems handle speed, scale, and reliability)
- **Risk and fraud detection** (using patterns in data to identify unusual behaviour)
- **Personal finance & automation** (tools that help users make better financial decisions)

**Why this matters to me:**  
FinTech combines real-world impact with challenging technical problems, which motivates me to keep learning and building.

## 2) Data Analytics & Visualisation

I enjoy analysing data and presenting insights clearly, especially through good visualisation choices.

Some aspects I like include:
- Turning messy data into useful, structured information  
- Choosing visuals that match the goal (comparison, trend, relationship, distribution)  
- Writing short explanations that help non-technical audiences understand the results  

**How it helps me:**  
This interest improves my ability to communicate findings and support decisions with evidence.

## 3) Software Development & Problem-Solving

I enjoy building practical solutions through programming. This includes:
- Writing clean and readable code  
- Debugging and improving existing work  
- Designing small features that solve specific user needs  

**How it helps me:**  
It develops my discipline, logical thinking, and attention to detail—useful for both academic projects and real work settings.

## 4) Continuous Learning & Growth

I like learning in small, consistent steps. My preferred learning habits include:
- Keeping short notes (e.g., commands, templates, common mistakes)
- Practising with mini tasks instead of only reading theory
- Reflecting on what worked and what didn’t after each assignment

**How it helps me:**  
This keeps me organised and helps me improve across different modules and projects.
